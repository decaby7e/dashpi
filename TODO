- If video.sh is disowned, it just restarts the process in Xorg...?

- Implement lock expiration?? e.g. xinitrc will watch the lock file and
  if the datetime in there is longer than some expiration duration,
  the lock is removed. This would require things like video.sh to
  continually update this file such that it never gets older than
  the expiration date.
